The Theme is from niivu
Unzip the Windows Theme rar and read his tutorial here for applying the theme: https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/How-to-install-Windows-10-or-11-Themes-708835586

It might mess up your wallpaper, cursor and accent color. Just change them after applying the theme.

For the Icons unzip the Icon.rar and follow the original guide from the theme:

To use the 7tsp Icon themes refer to the instructions here. https://www.deviantart.com/devillnside/art/7TSP-GUI-2019-Edition-804769422

Remove the '.remove' extension from the 7tsp files before loading into 7tsp patcher

For removing the ribbon in the Windows Explorer I use ExplorerPatcher and OldNewExplorer. I have attached photos for the settings.
To change the color of the top of the explorer use Winaero Tweaker and set the Inactive Title Bars Color to rgb(1,22,39)
